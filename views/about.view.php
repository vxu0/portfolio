        <p>I was born and raised in New Jersey before stepping out-of-state for college.
            I studied chemistry for two years at
            <a href='https://www.vassar.edu/about' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class="bg-blue-100 underline decoration-wavy decoration-gray-400 hover:bg-blue-200 hover:decoration-gray-500">
                Vassar College</a> in Poughkeepsie, NY,
            before transferring to the
            <a href='https://illinois.edu/about/index.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class="bg-blue-100 underline decoration-wavy decoration-gray-400 hover:bg-blue-200 hover:decoration-gray-500">
                University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>
            for a more robust STEM education and bigger campus experience.
            I received my
            <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">B.S. in CS + Chemistry</span>
            (its own program at the U of I) in August 2023. ðŸ¥³</p>
        <p>During that time, I solidified my CS fundamentals and worked on
            some really cool projects as coursework, both individually and on teams.
            I also had the opportunity my junior year to intern at a financial startup company called
            <a href='https://aqtivinvestments.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class="bg-blue-100 underline decoration-wavy decoration-gray-400 hover:bg-blue-200 hover:decoration-gray-500">
                Aqtiv Investments</a>,
            where I wrote code to analyze US stock exchange data.</p>
        <p>My favorite languages/tools to use so far are <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">React</span>,
        <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">Typescript</span>, and <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">PHP</span>.
            I've also fiddled with <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">Python</span>, 
            <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">C++</span>, 
            <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">Javascript</span>,  
            <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">HTML/CSS</span>,
            <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">SQL</span>, 
            <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">Docker</span>,
            <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">Tableau</span>, and 
            <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">Figma</span>. Yay learning ^_^
        <p>Tech stuff aside, I see myself most of all as a creative person!
            I've loved writing and drawing since I was little, and I think that
            side of me definitely comes out when I'm working on a new
            application, or really anything at all. I also like to cook, listen to music, go to the gym, take long walks, and
            spend time with friends. I'm a big introvert, but I love meeting new people.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">looking for a full-time job opportunity</span> as either a
           <span class="bg-lime-100 font-medium">frontend or backend software engineer</span> while continuing to
            learn through passion projects. My dream job is to create beautiful designs and user experiences as a developer,
            or more generally to work in a creative environment. If you've read up to here, you might as well hire me. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p>
